This is an academic project in pattern recognition. It will use a multilayered perceptron neural network trained using error backpropogation algorithm for character recognition. 

First step in the project is to recognise the typed characters and digits which are mostly separate and consistent. The next step is to extend it for handwriting recognition which is largely dependent on writers, styles etc and may need a feature vector extraction before neural networks.
